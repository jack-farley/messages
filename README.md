# messages

Messages is a web application for messaging.

This application is built using Django and Django Rest-Framework.

This project is still a work in progress. I have mostly finished the api for creating accounts and interacting with other users through friend requests and blocking, and I am currently working on adding Channels to allow for real-time messaging. In the future, I will also add a front-end to the project.
